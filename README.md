Adds a download button to Re:View Panopto to allow one to download lectures. 

Based on [Panopto-DL](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/416679-panopto-dl). 

## Improvements over Panopto-DL:
- Preserves the original uploaded filename.
- Does not open a new tab. Downloads the video while staying in same page.

## Coming Soon
- Bulk Download Functionality.
